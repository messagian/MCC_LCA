## Abstract
Heavy-duty transport sector is an important contributor to climate change and, it is also the skeleton for global economic activity: it moves goods and connects people; therefore, finding solutions for its decarbonization is of primary importance for governments. Its transition to zero-emission poses challenges because of its huge energy-density demand, the high reliability, and the extended capability traveling long distances; all features guaranteed only by fossil fuel combustion.  The study designs a carbon capture and temporary storing adsorption-based system to mitigate transport CO2 emissions onboard heavy-duty vehicles, using three classes of adsorbent materials respectively: metal-organic frameworks or, zeolites or solid amines for the capture part and Cr-soc-MOF for the storing. The study calculates the size, CO2 purity and recovery and power demand of the system and additionally quantifies the effective emission reduction through a comparative LCA study, showing the viability of heavy-duty vehicles decarbonization through onboard carbon capture and storage. 

Repository containing the scripts to interface with Aspen programmatically in this specific setup using python.
At the moment the code can only be run on windows due to the possibility of installing Aspen only on windows systems.
